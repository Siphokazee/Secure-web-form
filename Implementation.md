
I've applied several secure coding techniques to make our registration form more secure. Here’s a rundown of the key improvements:

Input Sanitization:
I added a sanitizeInput function that escapes special characters to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, ensuring that user input can’t be used to inject harmful scripts.

Email Validation:
To avoid invalid email addresses, I built a validateEmail function that checks if the input follows the correct email format.

Password Strength Checker:
I included a checkPasswordStrength function that evaluates how strong a password is. This feature provides users with real-time feedback about the complexity of their password, encouraging them to create stronger ones.

Password Hashing:
Instead of storing plain-text passwords, I'm using the SHA-256 algorithm to hash them before storage. I also integrated the js-sha256 library for client-side hashing to ensure password security from the start.

Password Confirmation:
To reduce user mistakes, I added a "confirm password" field that ensures users re-enter their password correctly before submitting.

Minimum Password Length:
The system now enforces a minimum password length of 8 characters to ensure that passwords meet basic security standards.

CSRF Protection:
Though not fully implemented yet (since it needs server-side support), I've laid the groundwork for integrating CSRF tokens to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks.

Secure Password Storage:
Passwords are securely stored as hashed values, meaning they’re encrypted and much harder for attackers to exploit if they were ever exposed.

Error Messages:
I’ve also updated our error messages to be more specific without giving away sensitive details, like whether the issue lies with the email or password, keeping potential attackers in the dark.

Content Security Policy (CSP):
Lastly, I added a basic Content Security Policy (CSP) header. This helps to prevent XSS and other types of code injection attacks by controlling what content can be executed on the page.
